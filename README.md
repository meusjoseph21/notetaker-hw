# Note Taker

  ## Description

  The Note Taker utilizes express to retrieve and store information on a local server. With the note taker users can access a deployed heroku application to create new notes, save notes that will load on page load, and remove notes from their previously saved notes. The note taker is great for people to use personally in their day to day life and business professionals to keep important information. The note taker was my first time using express and to be honest it was quite hard. The backend development seems like it will pose more challenges than front end for me. I will definitely have to take more time personally working on these coming homeworks but I am up to the challenge.
